# flatEnigmaMachine
A python function based on Kevin's enigma machine found [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKbP3Rjxhy0).  
To run it simply do;  
```
python/python3 enigma.py
```

and follow the prompts. 

Ensure that all text requirements are met as error handling is not supported yet (the app is very quickly put together)
